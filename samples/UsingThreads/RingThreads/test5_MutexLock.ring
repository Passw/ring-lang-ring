	  # threads over the same period of time, the statements executed will

#  What is a race condition? 
#
#  A race condition occurs when a program depends on the 
#  timing of one or more events to function correctly.
#
#  A race condition typically occurs when multiple threads
#  access a shared variable (or state) at the same time.
#
#
#  What is a mutex?
#
#  A mutex is a synchronization primitive that enforces 
#  limits on access to a shared resource when we have 
#  multiple threads of execution.

# URLShortener Application

Developed using the Ring programming language and RingQt

# Backend Service Retirement Notice

While the Ring-based interface remains fully functional and responsive, 
users should be aware that the backend service was officially retired. 
As a result, the application can still be launched and interacted 
with, but it will no longer be able to generate short URLs.

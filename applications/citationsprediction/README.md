# Backend Service Retirement Notice

The Citations Prediction application was developed using the Ring programming language 
for its front-end interface and Microsoft’s Machine Learning Studio (classic) as the backend 
prediction engine. While the Ring-based interface remains fully functional and responsive, 
users should be aware that the backend service—Machine Learning Studio (classic)—was officially 
retired on August 31, 2024. As a result, the application can still be launched and interacted 
with, but it will no longer be able to generate predictions or access the machine learning models 
previously hosted on the retired platform.
